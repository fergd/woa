# Web of Alexandria [WOA]

An Angular exercise to create a repository of learning resources ammassed from years of web development learning. 

## Setup of Project
* Jekyll (server)
* Angular 1.3.5
* Sass
* Gulp

## Story
Originally, I installed an Angular boilerplate to get the ball rolling: (angularjs-boilerplate)[https://github.com/jbutko/AngularJS-Boilerplate], however Sass was not compiling and there were quite a few deprecation warnings. To not spin my wheels too much, I switched course and actually went with building the app inside of Jekyll. This is not something I'd do for a production app, and not standard, but for the sake of ramping up quickly, it made sense. It's worth noting I also looked into doing this project with Meator and Angular as well. That's something I'd like to look in to for my own future projects. 

## Download
`git clone https://github.com/fergd/woa.git`
